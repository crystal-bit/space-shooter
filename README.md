<blockquote> Intro scene here: https://github.com/crystal-bit/into-the-breach-opening</blockquote>

*Space Shooter* is a shoot'em-up game created for the [Hacktoberfest 2019](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).  

It's intended for people who want to learn Godot game programming in a collaborative way.

## How can I contribute?

In two ways:

1. **Opening a new issue**: did you find a bug? Do you have an idea for the gameplay? Do you want to suggest an improvement? [Open a new issue](https://github.com/crystal-bit/space-shooter/issues/new).
1. **Working on an issue**: take a look at the open issues: https://github.com/crystal-bit/space-shooter/issues  
Did you find something that you would like to work on? Great! Then keep reading...

## Code style

Please follow [the official GDScript style guide](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html) when making pull requests.

Why? Well, everyone has his own preference when writing code, but when collaborating with others it's good to respect a common style. Since Space Shooter is a learning project, I think the best choice is to follow the official style guide.


### Please follow these simple rules ⤵️

1. ➡️ **Write a short message** in the issue itself to notify others that you are working on it.
2. ➡️ __Ask for help__ if you are stuck. You can push what you have, even if it is incomplete or it has some bug. We will review it and fix it.
3. ➡️ __Don't take a task if you don't have time to work on it__.
4. ➡️ __Happy coding__! I hope you will learn a lot during the process!

I hope these rules will help everyone having an enjoyable Hacktoberfest, avoiding conflicts!
