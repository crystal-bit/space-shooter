## _"Non parlo Inglese"_ (_"I don't speak English!"_)

🇮🇹 Non preoccuparti, aiutati con Google Translate e prova ad esprimere il concetto. Se proprio non riesci, scrivi in Italiano ma ricorda che sapere comunicare in Inglese è una skill importante da avere per lavorare nell'industria del software e dei videogame.
